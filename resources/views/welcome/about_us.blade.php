                     <h3>About Us</h3>
                     <p>Uruploadz LLC was established in 2016 in the state of Connecticut. We all have to admit that
                        they're millions of great music talents out there in the world. The lack of exposure are the
                        main reason why their voice hasn't yet been heard. Our goal as a organization is to assist
                        unsigned musical artist around the world, to promote their musical career on one single
                        platform. We've create a positive and user family <span>environment</span> , where music manger
                        and agents can discover the "NEXT BIG THING". Other musical site promotes both signed and
                        unsigned artist , which makes it difficult for the unsigned artist to really standout and be
                        heard. On Uruploadz we prefer to cater just to the unsigned. </p>
